## Model Assumptions

### Scenario Definitions

#### Moderate Scenario (10%)
- **Basis**: Conservative improvements using matrix values at face value
- **Maturity Factor**: Direct application of initiative maturity percentages
- **Industry Alignment**: Lower bound of published improvement ranges
- **Risk Profile**: Low risk, high confidence implementation

#### Elevated Scenario (20%)
- **Basis**: Moderate scenario + additional benefits from higher automation penetration
- **Enhancement Factors**:
  - Test automation benefits increased by 50% additional factor
  - Quality improvements affect post-release phases
  - Assumes deeper tooling integration and process maturation
- **Industry Alignment**: Mid-range of published case studies
- **Risk Profile**: Medium risk, requires sustained organizational commitment

#### Aggressive Scenario (30%)
- **Basis**: Elevated scenario + near-maximum credible improvements
- **Enhancement Factors**:
  - Test automation benefits increased by 75% additional factor
  - Quality improvements amplified across all downstream phases
  - Maximum savings caps per phase to prevent unrealistic projections
- **Savings Caps**:
  - Discover: 30% maximum savings
  - Plan: 35% maximum savings
  - Design: 40% maximum savings
  - Build: 45% maximum savings
  - Test: 50% maximum savings (highest due to automation potential)
  - Deploy: 40% maximum savings
  - Post Go-Live: 75% maximum savings (defect prevention benefits)
- **Industry Alignment**: Upper bound of credible published results
- **Risk Profile**: High risk, requires exceptional execution and mature practices

### Financial Model Assumptions

#### Cost Categories
- **Direct Cost Savings**: Development phases (Discover through Deploy)
  - Immediate reduction in project hours and associated labor costs
  - Measurable during project execution
  
- **Cost Avoidance**: Post Go-Live phase and ongoing support
  - Prevention of defects and issues that would require future fixes
  - Reduced support and maintenance overhead
  - Deferred costs rather than immediate savings

#### Labor Rate Model
- **Blended Rate**: Single hourly rate across all roles (default $100/hour)
- **Assumption**: Simplified model assumes consistent labor costs across phases
- **Future Enhancement**: Role-based costing for more precision

#### Risk Weights
- **Purpose**: Account for implementation difficulty and uncertainty by phase
- **Default Progression**: 1-7 multiplier (Discover=1, Post Go-Live=7)
- **Rationale**: Later phases have higher complexity and change risk
- **Application**: Multiplied against modeled hours for risk assessment

### Validation Boundaries

#### Maximum Total Cost Reduction
- **Limit**: 30% total cost reduction without radical scope changes
- **Basis**: Industry consensus that higher savings require fundamental project restructuring
- **Implementation**: Model warns when total reduction exceeds this threshold

#### Phase-Specific Constraints
- **Testing Phase**: Maximum 50% savings recognizing automation limits
- **Post Go-Live**: Maximum 75% savings acknowledging defect prevention benefits
- **Early Phases**: Lower caps reflecting limited automation opportunities

#### Maturity Scaling
- **Linear Application**: Maturity percentages applied linearly to matrix values
- **Assumption**: Benefits scale proportionally with implementation maturity
- **Reality Check**: May not reflect S-curve adoption patterns in practice

## Data Quality Standards

### Matrix Input Requirements
- **Hour Deltas**: Must be realistic relative to phase baseline hours
- **Sign Convention**: Negative values = hour savings, Positive values = additional effort
- **Granularity**: Initiative-level detail for meaningful maturity assessment
- **Validation**: Cross-check against published case study ranges

### Calculation Precision
- **Rounding**: Results displayed with appropriate precision for business decisions
- **Currency**: Whole dollar amounts for cost calculations
- **Percentages**: One decimal place for variance calculations
- **Hours**: Whole hour amounts for effort estimates

## Known Limitations

### Model Simplifications
1. **Linear Scaling**: Benefits may not scale linearly with maturity in practice
2. **Independence**: Assumes initiatives are independent (no interaction effects)
3. **Timing**: Does not model implementation sequencing or learning curves
4. **Context**: Generic model may not reflect organization-specific factors

### Data Dependencies
1. **Matrix Quality**: Results highly dependent on accurate initiative hour deltas
2. **Baseline Accuracy**: Phase allocation percentages must reflect actual project structure
3. **Rate Assumptions**: Single blended rate may not capture role-specific variations

### Industry Benchmark Limitations
1. **Temporal**: Research studies reflect specific time periods and market conditions
2. **Contextual**: Published case studies may not reflect Ellucian's specific environment
3. **Selection Bias**: Published results may overrepresent successful implementations

## Validation Methodology

### Internal Consistency Checks
- Phase allocation percentages sum to 100%
- No negative hours in final calculations
- Savings remain within credible industry bounds
- Risk-weighted calculations preserve relative relationships

### External Benchmark Alignment
- Total improvement percentages align with published research ranges
- Phase-specific improvements consistent with automation potential
- Financial benefits proportional to industry case study results

### Sensitivity Analysis Recommendations
1. **Maturity Variation**: Test model with different maturity level combinations
2. **Scenario Comparison**: Validate that scenarios show progressive improvement
3. **Phase Weight Sensitivity**: Assess impact of different baseline allocations
4. **Rate Sensitivity**: Evaluate model behavior with different labor rates

## Continuous Improvement

### Model Updates
- **Quarterly Review**: Update industry benchmarks with latest research
- **Calibration**: Compare model predictions with actual implementation results
- **Enhancement**: Incorporate feedback from model users and stakeholders

### Research Integration
- **New Studies**: Incorporate emerging research on shift-left practices
- **Case Studies**: Update assumptions based on additional implementation data
- **Technology Evolution**: Adjust for improvements in automation tools and practices
