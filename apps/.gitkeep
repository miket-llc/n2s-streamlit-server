# Apps Directory

This directory contains deployed Streamlit applications.

Each app should be in its own subdirectory with:
- app.py (or streamlit_app.py)
- requirements.txt
- .streamlit/secrets.toml (optional)
- README.md (optional)

Apps are automatically deployed via GitHub Actions or the deploy scripts.
